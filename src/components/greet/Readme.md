# Test Driven Development (TDD) / Red-Green Testing 
1 . make tests fail first by giving wrong input to check the test case functioning properly </br>

2 . make tests pass by giving valid input to check the test case functioning properly </br>

3 . if possible refactor the code to run in efficient way  </br>

4 . what is watch mode is , it watches the changes from last commit and when you run ```yarn test or npm test``` </br> 
    it runs the test cases related changed files . </br>

5 . jest gives search options with file name regex pattern , using ``` p option ``` and use arrow keys </br>

6 . jest also gives test based search regex pattern , using ``` t option ``` and using arrow keys </br>

7 . jest alo gives two methods , one is -> ```test.only("name",()=>{}) ``` to test only specific test </br>
                               , sec is -> ```test.skip("name",()=>{}) ```  to skip specific test </br>
